## About Me

Hello there, I'm Luminal. Welcome to my personal blog where I talk about many things, mostly Game Development and my hobbies. 

Mainly, you'll see the ups and downs of my experiences and we might have a laugh here and there, mostly at the expense of my pain and suffering. 

Little bit about me: I'm currently (on paper, at least) studying Computer Science as my degree. I've been in the game development scene for little over 2 years, mostly working with Godot and custom engines like Robust Toolbox.

Hope you enjoy your time here.
